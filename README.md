# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview

This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The primary goal is to predict stock prices based on historical data, specifically focusing on Googleâ€™s stock (GOOG). Users can input a date range and stock symbol to visualize and predict future prices.

## Deployment

You can view the deployed version of the stock prediction web app - https://prediction-goog-yf.streamlit.app/.

This application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud, which allows users to easily access and interact with the model's predictions. 
The app fetches stock data using the Yahoo Finance API and visualizes the predicted stock prices against actual prices.

## Features
- Interactive user interface built with Streamlit for seamless data input and visualization.
- Utilizes the Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical stock data.
- Preprocessing steps include scaling and sequence creation for LSTM input.
- LSTM model architecture with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Visualizations comparing predicted stock prices with actual prices.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udvale/stock-price-prediction.git
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Running Steamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run stock_prediction.py
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
3. Input the desired stock symbol (default is "GOOG") and select a date range.
4. Click "Load Data" to fetch and visualize the stock prices, and view the predictions.

## Trial and Error
During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered:

- **Data Availability**: Initially, insufficient historical data led to errors when creating sequences for training the LSTM model. This was resolved by ensuring the user selects a longer date range.
- **Model Overfitting**: The first iterations of the LSTM model exhibited signs of overfitting due to a lack of dropout layers. This was mitigated by adding dropout layers between LSTM layers.
- **Predictive Performance**: Early predictions were inaccurate, prompting experimentation with different window sizes for sequence creation and adjustments in the model architecture.

## Improvements
Throughout the project development, the following improvements were implemented:

- Enhanced User Guidance: Added informative messages in the UI to help users select appropriate date ranges for predictions.
- Model Optimization: Adjusted the LSTM architecture and hyperparameters, including the number of epochs and batch size, to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Visualization Enhancements: Improved the graphical representation of actual vs. predicted stock prices, making it easier to interpret results.
